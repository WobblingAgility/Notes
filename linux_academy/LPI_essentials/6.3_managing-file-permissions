Managing File Permissions
=========================

File and Directory Permissions
------------------------------

Permissions are set up in 10 characters. First is d or - and means directory or file The next 9 are 3 groups of 3 with each being a letter or a dash.

The 9 are:  
(directory)(user read)(user write)(user execute)(group read)(group write)(group execute)(other read)(other write)(other execute)  
If any is the character ith means true, else it is false.


Octal permissions: read is 4, write is 2, execute is 1 so 5 is read&execute(read only), 6 is read&write, 7 is all.

Modifying Permissions
---------------------

To change permissions use `chmod` and 3 octals (ex. 665) or use who+what (ex. u+x for user add execute).

To change the owner or group use `chown` with username:groupname. Only root(sudo) can change owner.

Both commands take `-R` for recursive.

To just change group use `chgrp` but `chown` is more flexible and usable because `chgrp` is only for users.
