Where Data is Stored
====================

Linux Processes
--------------

PID1 (process ID 1) is the first process started (systemd) and used to start all other processes.

View processes with the `ps` command or `top`

Processes have parents and children. Parents are programs that launched the process and children are processes started by the process.

System Logging
--------------

Logs get stored in `/var/log` and with systemd there is `/var/log/messages` but this is better accessed with `journalctl`.

Often logs are rotated where they are backed up at a certain date or size and compressed.

To view kernel ring logs use `dmesg` as this is in memory and not stored on disk.
