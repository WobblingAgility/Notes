Archiving

tar
---

The `tar` command was used for creating tape archives (hence the name) but is now used to archive files into tar balls. The flags used are:

-c Create a new archive  
-z Compress/uncompress the archive with the gzip algorithm.  
-j Compress/uncompress the archive with the bzip2 algorithm.  
-f The compressed file name.  
-x Extract an archive.  
-v Verbose output.  
-t List the compressed contents.

Order matters with tar so it should be done create (c) > compress (z,j) > file (f).

Other compression archive tools are:

zip and unzip\ 
gzip and gunzip\ 
bzip2 and bunzip2
