Using Directoris and Listing Files
==================================

The Linux Filesyste
-------------------

All distros follow the (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard)[http://www.pathname.com/fhs/].

The basics are:

- Inverted tree with a single root (/).
- Paths deliminated with /.
- Files starting with a single . are hidden.
- A single . is the current directory.
- A double . (..) is the parent directory.

The base directories in linux are:
- `bin` is where user executables are stored.
- `boot` containers the kernel and files needed to start the kernel.
- `dev` is where device refereces are.
- `etc` is the location of config files.
- `home` is the location of user directories.
- `lib` and `lib64` is the default location of 32bit and 64bit libraries respectively.
- `media` is the legacy location that CD, DVDs, and USB flashdrives were mounted.
- `opt` is optional binaries.
- `proc` is where information on the running system is.
- `root` is the root users home directory.
- `sbin` is for super user binaries.
- `srv` is a location for servers to server files/information.
- `sys` is where information on the host machine are stored.
- `tmp` is a temporary location to store files. Files in it do not survive reboot.
- `usr` is almost a user mirror of root container documents, fonts and other files as well.
- `var` is for files of variable size (ex. log files, VM image, system mail, etc...)

Absolute and Reletive Paths
---------------------------

An absolute path starts with the / (root) directory and lists the full path (ex. /usr/share).

A relative path is relative to the current directory and may involve `.` or `..`.
